I am both excited and nervous about this class because tech doesn't necessarily come easily to me but I know how necessary it is. And I weirdly really want one of those stickers...

# Hi! My name is Victoria Kamilar

I am a 2nd year ScM student in Infectious Disease Epidemiology, focused on zoonotic and arthropod-borne infectious disease from a One Health perspective. 

## Background/Research

My undergraduate degree was at Texas A&M doubling in Animal Science and Entomology. My research background has been primarily field and lab based (ask me about arthropods I dare you), this program has been my first real foray into proper analytics and modeling. 

## Analytics

Oow scary question, what is my experience with stats, programming, and data? Well you know the biostats 620 series all first year Epi students take... that. That is all of my experience. I guess you could also include my struggling in R with figure building and data cleaning over the summer as well as some light GIS work.

## Hopes and Dreams

I'm hoping this course will help provide me with a deeper understanding of programming, coding languages, and anything that will help me pick up new techy skills faster later. Also when I complained about being bad at R but really wanting to be better, a bunch of people suggested this course soooo....
