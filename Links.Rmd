### A Review of My favorite book 

[Spillover](https://berniegourley.com/2020/10/20/book-review-spillover-by-david-quammen/) by David Quammen is a must read for people interested in Infectious Diseases. Or at least I think so. If you click on "Spillover", the link will take you to a review of the book by Bernie Gourley. I am not familiar with his work but this was a pretty comprehensive review for those who are on the fence about reading the book which is on Audible by the way. 

### My go-to entertainment source

One of my favorite things is funny animal videos. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ERKLcJAzYk) is a video I found on youtube for your viewing pleasure. I'll be honest, I didn't watch the whole thing so if there is anything sketchy... sorry.
